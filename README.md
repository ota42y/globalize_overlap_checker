# GlobalizeOverlapChecker

When there are table and model this.

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    translates :name
end
```

And if posts table have `name` column, globalize overlap this column by translate method.   
In globalize 5.x, ActiveRecord's column data return overlaped column.  
But globalize 5.1 or later, thease method doesn't return overlaped column.  

And we shouldn't use overlaped column because its' difficult to understand.  

This gem check overlaped columns and generate removing migration and raise error when thease migration exist.
